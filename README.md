# Hybrid-DPI-Deepfake-Detector

# No_network
This folder contains source code to deploy your own model and have it tested on theoretically reconstructed image payloads.
They will be separated accordingly based on model used/trained.

There's one image there which already has its SHA256 made for.  This will flag within the system as fake automatically.
Use the script to generate your own signatures and it'll auto apply them to the signatures.txt.

``` python no_net_detector.py ```
